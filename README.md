## Key Features
- **Fetching Data from Unsplash API:** Image Gallery is powered by the Unsplash API, which provides access to a vast collection of high-quality, royalty-free images. You can easily fetch images to display in your gallery from this API, making it an excellent resource for photographers, designers, and content creators.
- **Image Search:** The project includes a search navbar that enables users to search for specific images. This feature is useful for finding images that match specific keywords, themes, or subjects, allowing for easy customization of your gallery.
- **Elegant UI Design:** Image Gallery boasts a visually appealing and user-friendly UI design, courtesy of Material UI. The design is carefully crafted to provide a pleasant and engaging experience for users. The layout and visual elements are thoughtfully designed to showcase your images in the best possible way.
